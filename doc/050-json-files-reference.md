# JSON Files Reference

The Hypersync SDK makes it possible to write custom Hypersync apps with very little code required. Instead of writing TypeScript or JavaScript code, declarative `.json` files can be created to describe how the custom Hypersync app should appear and function. These JSON files are then processed by the custom Hypersync at runtime as the user interacts with the app.

All declarative `.json` files live in the `/json` directory in the custom app's source. This directory may include one or more of the following file types.

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Reference                                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messages.json`       | Contains the strings that will be shown to the user when they interact with the custom app or view proof that is generated by the custom app.                                                      | [messages.json Format](./051-messages-json.md)              |
| `dataSource.json`     | For services that exposed data via a REST API, `dataSource.json` describes the data that is to be retrieved, along with the transforms, filters, sorts, etc. to apply to that data.                | [dataSource.json Format](./052-data-source-json.md)         |
| `criteriaFields.json` | Contains the criteria that the user must select to configure a given Hypersync proof type. These criteria fields can be used across proof types.                                                   | [criteriaFields.json Format](./053-criteria-fields-json.md) |
| `proofProviders.json` | Lists the JSON proof types that are exposed by the custom Hypersync app. See `/proof` below.                                                                                                       | [proofProviders.json Format](./054-proof-types-json.md)     |
| `package.json`        | Hyperproof uses these property values to properly identify and display your custom Hypersync app in the Hyperproof user interface.                                                                 | [package.json Format](./030-package-json-reference.md)      |
| `/proof`              | Directory that contains the JSON proof types used by the custom Hypersync app. To properly expose these proof types in the user interface, a corresponding entry in `proofTypes.json` is required. | [Proof Type Format](./055-proof-type-json.md)               |
